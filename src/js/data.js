      "A visual meditation on ritual, presence, and stillness — this shoot captures the quiet poetry of the tea ceremony. Each frame invites the viewer to slow down, notice detail, and enter a space where time softens. Porcelain, steam, and deliberate motion become symbols of care and intention. Rooted in tradition yet interpreted through a modern lens, the session blends cultural reverence with visual minimalism.",
